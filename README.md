Use `poetry install` in order to install all the required dependencies. If you are using [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in order to activate poetry virtual environment after installation. Run unit tests via `make test`, run the app via `make flask`. If you prefer to use containers, there are `make image` and `make container` scripts that will build a Docker image and run the app inside the image.
